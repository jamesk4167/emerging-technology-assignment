# Jupyter notebooks

This repository holds contains all of my notebooks for emerging technologies. The notebooks are all written in python and are layed out as follows

## Getting Started

The files contained inside this project are a mixture of jupyter notebooks and python files.
In order to install python you can go to their website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)<br>
You should also download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

## Components
Inside of this repository contains the following notebooks and scripts.
### Numpy Random notebook
Inside of this notebook I discuss the use of the numpy random package. I use matplotlib to visualize each of the distributions available.
### Iris dataset notebook
In this notebook I discuss the Famour Iris dataset, and attempt to write a machine learning algorithm which can successfully identify 
each type of flower. Inside of this notebook I have both a keras neural network and a Knn algorithm, which have both been trained on the dataset.
### Mnist notebook
Inside of this notebook I manipulate the mnist dataset. The purpouse of this notebook is to describe how to pull the mnist data from Yann Lecuns website 
and manipulate the data. The data is then inputted as training data into a neural network which is then tested on the test data also downladed from the mnist website.
### Digit Recognition.py
This script will take a user inputted image and guess what number it is. I use keras to create and train my model, which asks for a user inputted image,
for the purpoues of this assignment I have provided one with the repository, and then guesses what number it is.
### DigitRecognition.ipynb
A notebook describing the methodology behing the Digit Recognition script. All of the functions used inside of the Digit recognition script are 
described here.
